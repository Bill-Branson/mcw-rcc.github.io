!!! tip "Remote Access"
    Off-campus access to RCC resources is dependent on MCW-IS standard remote access methods. See [Remote Access](remote-access.md) for more details.

## Open OnDemand

Open OnDemand is a web browser-based interface to RCC computing resources. You can manage files, submit and monitor jobs, and run pre-configured interactive apps such as Jupyter and RStudio. All of this is possible without logging in via a traditional SSH terminal.

**This is the recommended login method for most users.** For more info, see [Open OnDemand](ondemand.md).

## SSH Connection

For advanced use case, SSH may be used to login. Please see [SSH Connection](ssh.md) for information about SSH clients and logging in.
