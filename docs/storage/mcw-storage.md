# Additional Storage Options

MCW offers multiple campus-wide storage options.

## MCW-IS Storage

Most users with MCW-owned or managed machines will recognize this storage as `G:\` drive on their Windows computer. This storage is free and backed up, but limited in size and performance, and meant for productivity data, i.e., documents, spreadsheets, etc. Please do not store raw research data. Contact MCW-IS help desk with questions.

## OneDrive

Every MCW user has a finite amount of free space available on OneDrive. This solution is cloud based, and utilizes your MCW credentials for access. It is suitable for productivity data, i.e., documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. Please do not store raw research data. In addition, there is a max file upload size, and an option to share data. Contact MCW-IS help desk with questions.

## Electronic Lab Notebook

Each electronic lab notebook has a finite amount of space available and a max single file upload size. ELN is free to all users, but should not be considered a primary storage system. ELN should be used to store data that would normally be stored in a paper notebook, or supplemental storage. Data sharing is possible.
