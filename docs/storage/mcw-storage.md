# Additional Storage Options

MCW offers multiple campus-wide storage options.

## MCW-IS Storage

Most users with MCW-owned or managed machines will recognize this storage as a `H:\` or `G:\` drive on their Windows computer. This storage is free and backed up, but limited in size and performance, and meant for productivity data, i.e., documents, spreadsheets, etc. Please send questions to the MCW-IS help desk.

## Box

MCW has an enterprise agreement with Box.com. Every MCW user has a finite amount of space available and a max single file upload size. This storage is free to all users, but should not be considered backed up, i.e., do not make Box your only data copy. Additionally, this storage is limited in size and performance, and meant for productivity data. Data sharing is possible. Please send questions to the MCW-IS help desk.
