# Reference Data
RCC maintains a reference data space on the cluster that is available to all users. It is located at <code>/hpc/refdata</code>. The purpose of this space is to provide central access to commonly used data. This allows users to save space and share a common reference dataset. RCC will also download or build reference data and connect it to applications when possible. 

Users may request to add reference data by contacting {{ support_email }}.
