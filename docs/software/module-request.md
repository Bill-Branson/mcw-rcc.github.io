# Requesting Software

All RCC users are eligible to request software installation. Read on to find out how we evaluate requests, and how to submit a request.

## Submitting a Request

To submit a software installation request, please email {{ support_email }} with the following information:

1. Name of the software
2. Link to the software files
3. Link to the software documentation
4. Brief description of need

RCC will evaluate the software based on your request. This process is much faster if the above information is included in the original request.

## Installation

RCC will evaluate your request to determine how to install the software. If approved, we will install the software in the `/hpc/apps` directory. Not all software requests will be centrally installed. For example, many R and Python packages can be installed without admin privileges. In that case, RCC admins would provide the proper installation command.

## Paid License Software

Some software packages require a paid license. Paid license software packages have additional requirements that RCC must evaluate. Often this includes what type of license (not all paid license types are supported), and other contractual terms that MCW must abide.

In order to avoid issues, please contact {{ support_email }} to setup a time to discuss your proposed installation. **Please note that the PI funding the software purchase must attend this meeting**.

!!! warning "Do not buy software for the cluster without talking to RCC first."
    RCC does not guarantee that your software can or will be installed on the cluster. It is up to you to contact RCC prior to purchasing the software. Failure to do so may result in delays and/or denial of installation.
